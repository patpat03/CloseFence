# CloseFence
Created program which uses a depth first algrithm to help minmize the area needed to enclose a number of points on a graph.
A scanner first reads a series of points which is then plotted and put into an adjacency matrix, which we can then apply dfs to in order to minmize the perimeter of
of rectangular boxes neded to enclose a complete cycle or "network" on the graph.
